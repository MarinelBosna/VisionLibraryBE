                "     In the Departure Lounge of Terminal One, a man is sitting reading a newspaper. He does not like airports. There are too many people, and he is always nervous when he flies. He looks at his watch impatiently. Then he hears the announcement over the loudspeakers.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "      ‘British Airways announce the departure of Flight BE570 for Istanbul. Will passengers please proceed to Gate 16 for boarding.’\n" +

                "     Twenty minutes later, the plane is preparing to leave. It moves slowly across the airport to runway number two. Tom is sitting looking out of the window.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "      The plane suddenly moves forward, races down the runway and rises into the air. Tom looks down at the houses and roads far below, and smiles. London is behind him. Now he is on his way to Istanbul.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     Tom relaxed and took a letter from his pocket.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "    I’m sure we will have a very nice holiday. Spring is here, and the weather is beautiful. I have to work on Monday 14th of April — the day you arrive. So I can’t come to the airport to meet you, but you can take a taxi from the Air Terminal to Taksim Square. That’s in the centre of the new part of the city. There’s a big hotel called the Park Hotel near the square. I’ll meet you there at 5 o’clock. We’ll meet in the American Bar. The view over the city is beautiful.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     I can’t wait to see you again, Tom. I have so much to tell you. So remember, the Park Hotel, Taksim Square, 5 o’clock.\n" +

                "     ‘Have you been to Istanbul before?’ said a voice. It was the young man in the next seat.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    ‘No, I haven’t,’ said Tom. ‘Have you?’\n" +

                "\n" +
                "    The two men sat talking, as the stewardesses began serving lunch. The young man told Tom his name was Kemal. His parents had a shop in Istanbul.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    ‘Are you meeting someone in Istanbul?’ Kemal asked.\n" +
                "\n" +

                "    ‘That’s interesting. How long has she been there?’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    She went to Istanbul two months ago. She works for a small company which is starting to export to England. She’s making all the arrangements.’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "‘Exporting always seems so difficult,’ said Kemal. ‘It seems difficult,’ Tom agreed. ‘But that’s Angela’s job. She’s an expert in importing and exporting. Her father has an import/export agency in London and she has worked for him for some years. She’s almost completed her work in Istanbul now. The company has already started to send goods to England. She’ll be coming back to London soon.’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     ‘What kind of goods do they export?’ asked Kemal. ‘All kind of things — brass ornaments, coffee-pots, trays leather and onyx articles — Angela’s father thinks these goods will sell very well in England.’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    ‘That’s interesting,’ said Kemal. ‘My parents sell things like that in their shop in Istanbul.’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    The two men went on talking as the plane flew over Italy and Greece towards Turkey. Soon they were descending to Yesilkoy Airport, Istanbul.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    When the plane stopped, Kemal stood up. ‘I hope you enjoy your stay in Istanbul,’ he said.  ‘Here’s my telephone number. If you need anything, phone me. I live in Sisli. It’s not far from the centre of the city.’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    ‘Thanks, Kemal, that’s very kind of you.’\n" +
                "\n" +

                "\n" +
                "     Soon they were driving past the houses and apartment blocks near the city.  Then they passed the old city walls. Tom felt excited, and looked at everything. He saw beautiful old mosques and street markets.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     The bus was now approaching the centre of old Istanbul. It stopped at some traffic lights.\n" +

                "     A car stopped beside the bus. The door opened and a woman got out. Two men were with her. Suddenly Tom jumped to his feet. It was Angela!\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     ‘Angela!’ Tom shouted. ‘Angela! Here! It’s me, Tom!’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    He knocked on the bus window. Suddenly the traffic lights changed and the bus moved forward. Tom ran to the back of the bus. Angela and the two men were going into a building.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     ‘Angela!’ he shouted. ‘An…’ He stopped. It was too late. The bus was moving quickly down a wide street. The passengers were looking at Tom and he suddenly felt foolish. He walked back to his seat and sat down.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     What a surprise, he thought to himself. I must tell her when I see her this evening. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "    Then the bus crossed Ataturk Bridge and Tom looked at the boats on the Golden Horn. Again he felt excited.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    The bus arrived at the Air Terminal at a quarter to four.  There were some taxis waiting there. Tom went up to one.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     ‘The Park Hotel, Taksim Square, please,’ he told the driver.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "    Tom went into the hotel. He found the American Bar and sat down at a table on the terrace. A waiter came out.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    ‘A beer, please,’ said Tom.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    He sat in the afternoon sunshine, and looked down over the city of Istanbul. The view was very beautiful. He was looking at the sea. The Bosphorus was full of ships. There were very big ships going to Russia and little sailing ships. In the distance, he could see the mosques and palaces of old Istanbul. How beautiful and how exciting!\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     Tom looked at his watch. It was nearly five o’clock. He got up and walked up to the hotel entrance. There were lots of people going in and out of the hotel. But he did not see Angela anywhere. He went back to the bar and ordered another beer.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    Come on Angela, Tom said to himself. Don’t be late.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     Just inside the American Bar a man in a grey raincoat was sitting at a table. He was drinking coffee and smoking cheap cigarettes. A newspaper lay open on the table in front of him, and from time to time he looked at it. But the man wasn’t reading the newspaper — he was watching Tom.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     It was now twenty past five. Tom sat in the evening sunshine. He looked at his watch again, and waited. Half past five. Quarter to six. It was getting dark. He looked at the lights on the Bosphorus. Strange, thought Tom. Angela isn’t usually late.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    Tom sat at the table, on the terrace of the American Bar, waiting for his fiancee.  He waited, and waited, and nobody came.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    And the man in the grey raincoat sat patiently inside the bar, smoking, and watching Tom.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     ‘Another beer, sir?’ asked the waiter.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "     Tom went into the hotel. There was a telephone beside the reception. Tom dialled Angela’s number. The phone rang and rang, but nobody answered it. He put the phone down and turned towards the reception desk.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     ‘Excuse me,’ he asked the receptionist, ‘Kamerot Sokak — do you know where it is?’\n" +

                "     ‘Yes, it’s very near. Go out of the hotel entrance and turn right. Walk along the street — and Kamerot Sokak is fourth on the right.’\n" +

                "     Kamerot Sokak was a narrow, quiet street of old apartment buildings. Tom walked along the pavement, looking at the numbers on the doors. There was only one street light and it was difficult to see. But finally, he found Angela’s address, number 11.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     The building had a large glass door. Tom pushed it, but it was locked. There was no bell. He knocked on the door.  Nothing happened. He knocked again, louder this time, and listened. Silence.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    Damn, he thought. He was impatient now. And worried.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "     Angela, he said to himself, Angela! Where are you?\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     A short distance away, the man in the grey raincoat stood in a dark doorway. He was watching Tom, watching every move he made…\n" +

                "    Tom did not know what to do. He knocked once more on the glass door — again nothing happened. Finally, he picked up his suitcase. With a last look at the building, he turned and started walking back towards Taksim Square.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "     Tom Smith, he thought to himself, as he walked. You need a hot bath and a good sleep. Then you can decide what to do.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    The Park Hotel was expensive, but Tom remembered seeing one or two small hotels near Taksim Square. Finally, he was standing outside the Ankara Hotel. He went in.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "    ‘Good evening,’ he said to the woman at reception. ‘I’d like a single room, please.’\n" +

                "     ‘That was difficult,’ said Pennington. ‘As you know, the accident happened on a dangerous road about 200 kilometres from here. Your fiancee’s car crashed through a wall by the side of the road, and fell down the hillside. The car burst into flames and was completely burned out. The — the body was very badly burned, so identification was difficult. But the police found your fiancee’s handbag lying near the car. Her passport and papers were in the handbag. The police found out that the car was owned by a car hire company.  Miss Thomson had hired the car for the weekend.’\n" +
